# Aokana Extra 1 - Bad Vietnamese Translation Project
The solo Vietnamese translation project for Aokana EXTRA 1. No ETA

Dự án dịch solo Aokana EXTRA 1 sang Tiếng Việt. Không ETA

# Regarding the status of the project:
For the past few months, the project hasn't been updated due to lack of motivation on my side, and my lacks of experience when it comes to translation, it was bad, ngl, but well, I want to see this project comes to its end, so I've decided to reboot this project. That means we'll start from the beginning, I want to make sure that the translation is as high as it can be. I think I can start working on it again in the beginning of October. So yeah, please look forward to this project.

There's nothing here at the moment, the repo will be update once the project is in a better shape
